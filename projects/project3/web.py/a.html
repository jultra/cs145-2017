The two smaller holders measure approximately 10&#34; (outer diameter) and 8 7/8&#34; (inner diameter). They are both in good condition and have a gold colored ring on the inner circle.

The two smaller holders measure approximately 10&#34; (outer diameter) and 8 7/8&#34; (inner diameter). They are both in good condition and have a gold colored ring on the inner circle.

On the reverse of the tin is the story of David McConnell and how he started Avon. The tin is beginning to rust on the base and has some rust and scratches. This tin belonged to my sister for many years. I believe there is supposed to be a blue top to the tin, but it is gone. The top is rusting considerably, but it is still a pretty Avon memorabilia piece. Shipping and handling will be $2.20 for US sales. Please, no Paypal. Thanks for looking, and good luck!

			<span>LLADRO # 7644: INNOCENCE in BLOOM - from my own PERSONAL COLLECTION - is a MAGNIFICENT &amp; MINT RETIRED LLadro porcelain figurine standing 9.50 inches tall. This figurine has the blue LLadro logo and flower on its base and comes in it&#39;s ORIGINAL LLadro box. It was first made in 1996 and was RETIRED in 1996, making it available for that one year only, as LLadro&#39;s Annual Club Figurine. It sells on the LLadro web sites for $350. NOTE: Each and every flower is perfect, hard to find this way - it is in PRISTINE condition. It&#39;s worth every bit of that price, it&#39;s a real gem. Win this auction and get it at a fraction of that cost. High bidder to pay by Postal Money Order and ADD $20 for fragile shipping and insurance. WILL BE MAILED IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS + PLUS + FREE GIFT: EBAY ITEM # 1044400095, WILL BE YOURS FREE IF YOU ARE THE HIGH BIDDER ON THIS AUCTION. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!
